// create a variable called number_of_names that contains the number of people in your names array
var number_of_names = names_array.length;
// create a variable called age and put an appropriate data type in it
var age = 33;
// create a variable called younger that contains a third of this age
var younger = age / 3;
// create a null variable called empty
var empty = null;
// create a variable called phone_number and store this number 07888777396
// ( think about what type of data would be best for this )
var phone_number = "07888777396";
// create a variable called friend
// extract the second value from your names_array and put it in friend

// create a variable called quote that contains the following sentence
// I'm not a number, I'm fairly sure I'm a String
var sentence = "I'm not a number, I'm fairly sure I'm a String";
// create a variable called sentence_length that contains the length of the sentence

// BONUS
// Research how to create a JSON object called person
person = {
  "first_name":"Mishu"
}
// Use the person object tests to add the correct data
